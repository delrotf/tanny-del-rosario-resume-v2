        <dd>It is an implementation of TIE (Trading Information Exchange) used by Argos (UK&apos;s leading general merchandise retailer). TIE is a complete solution that comprises consultancy, implementation, customization, hosting and community management
            services; is a demand chain visibility service that enables retailers and manufacturers to exchange extensive operational information and jointly manage key business processes. By delivering a single, shared, real-time view of critical supply
